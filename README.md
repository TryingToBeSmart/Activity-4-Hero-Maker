# Activity 4 Hero Maker Form
Windows Forms app to create heros using a bunch of assorted controls.  The first form creates a SuperHero object and adds it to the HeroList.  The 2nd form displays the list of SuperHeros from the HeroList and then when each hero is clicked on in the listbox, a 2nd listbox populates all of the hero's attributes.  
I started to make a WPF, but ran out of time.
